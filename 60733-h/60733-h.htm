<p class="pcap">Silverton, Looking South Toward Durango</p>
</div>
<p>Silverton, with all its scenic splendor, nestles in a valley 9,302
feet in altitude. It is surrounded by four mountain peaks, all of
which rise above timberline, and are usually snow covered the year
around; Kendall Mountain to the East, Anvil Mountain to the West,
Boulder Mountain to the North, and Sultan Mountain to the South.
The highest of these peaks is Sultan, which rises to a dizzy height of
13,336 feet. Opposite this is Kendall that juts skyward 4,000 feet
above the floor of the valley. Silverton is centered in the rugged,
majestic San Juan Mountains, and nowhere in the nation is there
another 100,000 square miles of such spectacularly scenic grandeur.</p>
<p>One evening, a group of men were in a saloon discussing the
possibilities of the San Juan. One fellow remarked, &ldquo;We have silver
by the ton&rdquo;, and thus Silverton got its name. It is the only incorporated
town in the county, and boasts not an acre of farm land.</p>
<p>Silverton was, at one time, named Baker&rsquo;s Park after Charles
Baker who led a group of prospectors to this country in 1860 or
1861. There is no record of any permanent locations made, or of
any quantity of mineral taken out, though there were indications of
prospecting being done. As you can imagine, Baker and his party
endured many hardships. Relics, broken wagon parts, and some
discarded camp equipment lead to the belief the party came by way
of Durango, thence to Cascade Creek along the route of our present
highway. From there they went to the West of Spud Mountain and
kept fairly high, crossing Coal Bank Hill and following around the
head of Lime Creek. After passing Lime Creek, they crossed the
hills East of there and came down into the park by way of Bear
Creek. There is a place on Bear Creek which shows they let their
wagons down the hillside by means of a rope, as the stock was evidently
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
unable to hold the wagons under control.</p>
<p>Charles Baker had a narrow escape in 1862 near Eureka. One
of the men organized a mutiny, crying out to hang Baker, claiming
he had deceived them. Baker heard of it and escaped, otherwise
he would have met his fate at the hands of his own men. In 1868,
Baker again set out from Denver for Silverton, as he still believed
gold was here, and arrived in the San Juan in 1871. He was killed
in this vicinity by the Indians shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Dempsey Reese, Miles T. Johnson, Adam French and Thomas
Blair outfitted in Santa Fe and arrived in the San Juans in 1870. They
were the first lode prospectors, as Baker and his party had been
searching for placer gold.</p>
<p>No one wintered in Silverton during the years 1870-&rsquo;71-&rsquo;72.
Dempsey Reese and his party, accompanied by William Mulholand
and Francis M. Snowden, came back the following spring, and this
was the first record of any permanent discovery, namely, the &ldquo;Little
Giant Gold Mine&rdquo;, located in Arastra Gulch. The lode produced ore
of such quantity and value as to warrant its being packed on burros
to Pueblo for processing. Samples of the ore showed from 400 to
900 ounces of gold per ton. This rich ledge, which was treated by
arastras, was without a doubt the beginning of the future of the San
Juans. The first quartz mill for the reduction of ore was built in
1873 for the use of the Little Giant Mine.</p>
<p>There were about forty or fifty prospectors in the county by
this time, but the year 1873 was a banner year for mining claims.
More than three thousand claims were recorded, and the population
grew by several hundred. Many of the large producers were located
in that year and in 1872. Notably the Sunnyside, Shenandoah,
Silver Lake and portions of the Gold King Group. Some of the
Shenandoah claims have produced ore in considerable quantities
each year since 1875.</p>
<p>Within months after being married, Mr. Stoiber of Silver Lake
Mine fame, became one of the richest men in the state of Colorado.
Two of Mrs. Stoiber&rsquo;s claims to fame were having four husbands,
and building the huge Stoiberhof Mansion in Denver and the Silver
Lake Mansion in Silverton. At her first home in Silverton, Mrs.
Stoiber had an argument with her neighbor, so she eliminated him
from her consciousness by building a towering wall around her property
which completely cut off her view of him. Apparently this action
struck her fancy, for she was to repeat it. When Mr. Stoiber
sold his mining interests to the Guggenheim family for a reported
two and a half million dollars, he built the biggest, gaudiest, and
most lavish house in Denver. &ldquo;Stoiberhof&rdquo; was completed in 1906,
and was filled with the most fabulous collection of objets d&rsquo;art
Denver had ever seen. Again in Denver Mrs. Stoiber argued with
the owner of the adjoining property, and again she built a wall
twelve feet high around her grounds. Egbert W. Reed, the owner,
armed himself with a court order, and for months the affair dragged
through the courts. Mrs. Lena Allen Webster Stoiber Rood Ellis died
in Italy in March, 1935. Few remember her, or the fact that her first
fortune came from the Silverton area.</p>

<p>San Juan County, in its entirety, was included in the grant to the
Ute Indians in 1868. Three years later, when mining began to boom,
the Indians protested against the whites coming into their territory.
In 1872, troops were sent out by the government to keep the miners
off this grant and in February, 1873, an order was issued by the Department
of the Interior warning all miners to vacate by June 1st.
The troops had proceeded up the Rio Grande a considerable distance
when the order was suspended by the President, and a new treaty
was made with the Indians, which was effected by paying Chief
Ouray $1,000.00. The Utes surrendered some three million acres
of land.</p>
<p>In July, 1873, while
the Brunot Treaty was
pending between the Ute
Indians and the United
States Government for the
lands of the reservation,
when the great excitement
over the rich and
extensive mining broke
out, Mr. Tower made arrangements
with Jackson
Foundry and the George
Trick Hardware Company
of Denver for the materials
to erect a sawmill.
This was shipped by the
D. &amp; R. G. Railroad to Colorado
Springs. There a contract
was made with the
freighters to deliver this
to Silverton. The charges
were sixteen cents per
pound. The journey to
Del Norte was a pleasant
one, but then the trouble
began. From the South Fork of the Rio Grande River, sixteen miles
above Del Norte to the head waters of the stream, they forded the
river fifty-seven times. The outfit consisted of three teams, ten persons
and 6,000 pounds of freight. Only the old pioneers of the area
can fully understand the trouble, dangers and hardships encountered
in working freight over the mountains in those days. Two weeks
after leaving Del Norte, they arrived at the present site of Howardsville.
Aided by a number of miners they were able, after a week
of hard work, to get the wagons to Silverton. A location was made
for the mill on Mineral Creek at the foot of Sultan Mountain, and
here Mr. Tower erected the first sawmill. Mrs. Tower, a bride of
nineteen from Chicago, accompanied the party and returned in the
fall to Del Norte. Thus, Mrs. Tower was the first white woman in
Silverton.</p>

<p>The first mercantile establishment in the county was a combined
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
saloon and general merchandise store located at Howardsville.
This was in 1874, and the post office at Howardsville was opened
that same fall with W. H. Nichols as postmaster. Mrs. Nichols, Mrs.
W. E. Earl, Mrs. John F. Cotton, and Mrs. H. F. Tower were among the
first women in the county. Mrs. Merril Doud came a few weeks
later.</p>
<p>When the population of southern Colorado had grown to such
an extent that a Courthouse was necessary, Howardsville was the
center of population and therefore the logical site for the county
seat of La Plata County. A small log building was erected and served
the entire western slope from the northern to the southern boundary
and from the San Luis Valley to the western line of the state. In
the summer of this year the county seat was moved from Howardsville
to Silverton. The first store in town was called Greene and
Company, and Francis M. Snowden built the first cabin. It was located
where the hospital now stands on the avenue that bears his
name, and was the social gathering place of the town. All the noted
personages who visited in the early days stopped here, and if the
&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; as he was known, had kept a register it would be an interesting
document today. Dances were held there, with John and
Armanda Cotton furnishing the music.</p>

<p>Also in 1874 a preliminary survey of the township was made
by Thomas Trip and a complete survey was made that same year by
William Monroe and J. M. Hanks. As the streets came into being,
they were given names of the prominent pioneers of the 70&rsquo;s&mdash;Greene,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Reese, Snowden, Blair, etc. The following year was a busy
one. The first white child in Silverton was born to Mr. and Mrs. Ben
Harwood. The child was named Frank, and lived here his entire life.
Ben Harwood was quite a noted character in the early life of the San
Juans. He was without a doubt a very strong and untiring man. It
is an authenticated fact that for several winters he packed the mail
on snowshoes from Watson&rsquo;s Cabin, at the foot of Grassy Hill, to
Howardsville and Silverton, at the same time carrying from fifty to
sixty pounds of beef on his back for the Highland Mary Mine.</p>

<p>The La Plata Miner was the first newspaper, with John R. Curry
of Iowa as editor and owner. Several years later the name was
changed to the Silverton Miner, and since 1920 it has been called
the Silverton Standard and the Miner. From 1874 it has never missed
an issue. Still to be seen at the Standard office is the old 1830

<p>A road, barely passable,
from Watson&rsquo;s Cabin
at Grassy Hill to Howardsville
and Silverton by
way of Stony Pass was
completed. The grade
from the cabin to timberline
on this side of the
pass was fairly good, but
just below the timberline
was a short, steep pitch
which often defied the
brakes. Freighters would
cut a fair sized spruce
tree and tie it on behind
their wagons as a holdback
over this pitch.</p>

<p>When trees were no
longer available, Squire
(W. D.) Watson selected a
solid stump at the top of
the incline, and lowered
the wagons by means of a snubbing rope. The price was $2.50 for
about two-hundred feet, which made it pretty profitable. The summer
travel was from five to twenty wagons daily. The freight rate
at this time from Del Norte to Silverton was 30 dollars a ton, and
remained so until the coming of the railroad.</p>
<p>The first United States District Court was held in Silverton, with
Judge Hallett presiding. It seems the same faces were appearing in
the jury box, and the reason was the benches were so splintery they
had to choose men who wore leather seats in their trousers.</p>
<p>President Grant appointed J. M. Hanks as the first postmaster.
For several weeks after the appointment, he could find no building
suitable for a postoffice and carried the mail in his pockets and handed
it out on the streets when he saw any of the addressees. Mail
services were few and far between in the winter of 1875 and &rsquo;76.
Twice, Big Alec Fleming brought in on his back a load of mail from
Del Norte, wearing snow shoes or skis nearly every foot of the way.</p>
<p>Our first school was started this year. When the town was laid
out, a lot on the corner of Snowden Avenue and Eleventh Street had
been set aside for school purposes. The school served as a church
or for any public gathering, and was a low, log building. In 1887
the school record states they had six visitors and 144 cases of tardiness.
In 1879, the census showed forty pupils between the ages of
six and twenty-one, and by 1890, the total school attendance was
153.</p>
<p>The start of the Durango-Silverton road was made in 1875. A
crude mountain road reached from the present site of Rockwood for
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
about sixteen miles to the top of Coal Bank Hill. Here the road
ceased and the Old Ute Trail was used by pack animals for the remaining
fourteen miles into Silverton. The old trail was used until
about 1877 or &rsquo;78 when a prospector, with the help of others, built
a toll road up the Animas Canyon. The road started north of Rockwood,
crossed the site of what is now Lake Electra, then made a drop
of 2,000 feet in a distance of one and a half miles to the bottom of
the canyon. Here it crossed Cascade Creek at its junction with the
Animas and continued up the river to Silverton, making many crossings
along the way. A toll gate was located at the entrance to the
canyon near the Champion Mine. There was also a toll gate at
Baker&rsquo;s Bridge below Rockwood, and the fee was $3.00. Many
parts of the old road can still be seen from the train.</p>

<p>Otto Mears, known as the Pathfinder of the San Juan, laid out
a system of toll roads through the San Juans, branching in all directions
from Silverton&mdash;up the river to Eureka and Animas Forks, over
the Ophir Range, down the San Miguel River to the Dallas, across to
Telluride and again across to Rico and Rockwood, and from Silverton
to Ouray&mdash;four hundred miles, mostly toll. Like networks these
roads were, and are, of untold benefits. In 1875 Mears was paid
the grand sum of $600.00 for building a road up the Animas River
from Silverton to Howardsville, Eureka, Animas Forks, and Mineral
Point, apportioned as follows: Silverton to Howardsville, $150.00;
Howardsville to Eureka, $150.00; and from Eureka to Mineral Point,
$300.00.</p>
<p>La Plata County was cut off from San Juan County in 1876, and
Silverton was incorporated. At that time the town was said to have
around 500 voters. The first meeting of the council was held, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
among the board members was F. M. Snowden. After the division
of San Juan and La Plata counties, our county was still of considerable
size and in January, 1877, Ouray, San Miguel, and a portion of
Dolores counties were set off, leaving San Juan at its present size.</p>
<p>In 1877, Otto Mears built a road from Animas Forks to Lake
City. Most of the ore from Poughkeepsie Gulch, Mineral Point and
Animas Forks was treated at Lake City.</p>
<p>One of the oldest Masonic Lodges in the state is the San Juan
Lodge No. 33, A. F. &amp; A. M. which was organized in 1877. The organization
has had a remarkable life, and is a strong factor in the
community.</p>

<p class="pcap">Congregational Church, Built in 1881</p>

<p>The Congregational Church was organized in 1878. Although
faced by many trials and tribulations, and at times by lack of money,
the church has managed to survive. The present church building
was constructed in 1881 and A. P. Roberts was the pastor from 1878
to 1882.</p>
<p>This same year, Charles Fisher, who built the brewery at Howardsville,
moved it to Silverton and ran it for many years in the old
stone building on the bank of Mineral Creek at the lower end of the
town. He built the Fisher Building on Greene Street which is the
brick building occupied and owned for the past several years by the
Maffey family (French Bakery). The building next to Maffey was
the livery stables. The wagons and carriages were housed on the
ground floor and the horses were taken up a ramp and stabled on
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the second floor.</p>
<p>The first record of Lynch Law was in August 31 of this year.
The following is a report from a newspaper: &ldquo;About two o&rsquo;clock in
the morning of August 31, 1878 unknown parties entered the jail
and took Henry Cleary, charged with the murder of James M. Brown,
and hung him on the ox frame in the rear of the blacksmith shop on
upper Greene Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silverton had become a town of considerable population by
1879, and fire protection became a necessity. A &ldquo;hook and ladder&rdquo;
was ordered from Denver, and with news of its arrival at Grassy Hill
at the head of the Rio Grande, nearly half of the male population
started for Grassy on horseback and on burros. The hook and ladder
with all its equipment was hauled to Howardsville where it was met
by another group who brought it into Silverton by hand. The Silverton
Cornet Band led the group from Howardsville, and that evening
a big celebration was held. At the old City Hall on Blair Street,
next door to Swanson&rsquo;s Market, you can still see part of the old fire
fighting Hose Cart; also two cells of the old county jail remain there.</p>
<p>Patrick, better known as &ldquo;Cap&rdquo; Stanley, opened the first brick
yard at the foot of the hill between Reese Street and the Walsh
Smelter. He built the first two brick homes in Silverton on the east
side of upper Greene Street, and they are yet in very good condition.
The bricks for the Grand Imperial Hotel were made in this yard.
&ldquo;Cap&rdquo; was the leader of the Vigilantes, and a bluff, stern person.
The Vigilantes did their work well, but at one time the town council,
realizing that matters were becoming serious, hired the famous Bat
Masterson of Dodge City fame to clean up the town. Needless to
say, he did.</p>
<p>Fred Steinger secured a government contract for ten thousand
dollars to bring the mail to Silverton from Parrot City. This was
known as the Star Route and was a daily schedule with three stops
and three changes of horses each trip. Meals and sleeping quarters
were provided for the passengers should they desire or be forced to
stay. There were log barns at all stops, and care for the horses was
provided. It was not an unusual sight to see one hundred to one
hundred and fifty pack animals turned out for grazing on the slopes
of the hills. All went well during the summer, but winter was not
so good. The carriers started in wagons, then later had to leave the
wagons and use horses. Finally, when the snow got so deep at the
stop below Silverton, a carrier by the name of Snyder would use his
dog team and sled. He would pile the mail, general merchandise,
and supplies on the sled, then he would perch himself on top of the
load and be on his way. The sled was pulled by his huge black
dogs that were both strong and savage. Snyder and his dog team
also hauled water for the town in winter. He would fill six five-gallon
oil cans, put them on the sled, and he and his trusty dogs
were off to deliver water at fifty cents a can. The dogs were also
utilized at funerals when the snow was too deep for the heavier animals.
Snyder took good care of his dogs, and after a hard trip, so
the story goes, he would give each of them a drink of whiskey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>In 1879, a fire broke out in the forests near Molas Pass. There
are two stories told about the &ldquo;Molas&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lime Creek&rdquo; burn. One
is, the fire was started by a camp fire left burning by careless campers,
and the other, which is the most popular, that the Indians had
set the forest afire to smoke out the white settlers. There had been
trouble between the Utes and the whites, and men at the Animas
Forks section, seeing the smoke, thought it was an Indian uprising
and hid in the mine for several days. The blaze burned more than
26,000 acres of timberland and consumed an estimated 150 million
board feet of timber.</p>
<p>Replanting of the burn began in 1924, and since then about
1,000 trees have been planted annually. Even so, eighty-three years
later, the scars remain. Beautiful Molas Lake, owned by the Town
of Silverton, is located five miles south and near the summit of Molas
Pass. Silverton is surrounded by seven lakes above timberline that
teem with native trout. So high are they that stocking is done by
airplane.</p>

<p>In 1880, Otto Mears had a toll road from Saguache to Silverton,
via Poncha Pass, Marshall Pass, Gunnison, Cebolla, Lake Fork, Animas
Forks, Eureka and Howardsville, totalling 200 miles, with eight
to ten toll stations.</p>
<p>May 28, 1880, Thatcher Brothers of Pueblo opened the Bank of
Silverton. In July, 1880, Jefferman and Johnson opened the Bank
of San Juan. This bank was sold to the Thatchers in 1882.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>In December, 1882, application was made for a charter, and on
April 18, 1883, the First National Bank was opened. This bank had
only two cashiers in fifty-one years. It was liquidated in 1934, paying
one-hundred cents on the dollar. This bank was located on the
corner of Greene and 13th Streets, which is now the Recreation Hall.</p>

<p class="pcap">Thomas Walsh Residence in Animas Forks, as It Looks Today</p>
</div>
<p>The year 1881 saw the construction of the Martha Rose Smelter,
the slag piles of which still remain at the southwestern edge of the
town. A few years later this smelter was purchased by Thomas
Walsh who had mined quite extensively in the Animas Forks section.
The old Walsh residence still stands in Animas Forks. When Otto
Mears built the Silverton Railroad from Silverton to Ironton Park, the
smelter treated an average of over fifteen cars of crude ore a day.
It was from this smelter that Mr. Walsh obtained the money to purchase
the Camp Bird Mine. The production and sale of the Camp
Bird brought him over ten million dollars. His daughter, Evelyn
Walsh McLean, was once the owner of the famous Hope Diamond.
&ldquo;Cap&rdquo; Stanley once refereed a prize fight held at the Walsh Smelter
and entered the ring as the third man with a gun strapped around
his waist. There was no doubt as to the superiority of one of the
contestants, but evidently thinking of getting a return bout, which
might make him another fifty to a hundred dollars, he made no effort
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
to win. Cap, quickly discerning the trend of things, pulled his
gun and ordered the men to fight. A quick knock-out was the result.</p>

<p>In its heyday, Blair Street reveled around the clock. No less
than thirty-two establishments lined its two gay blocks and beckoned
from the fringes of the side streets. The gambling houses carried
such names as Mikado, National, Diamond, Sage Hen, and Bon Ton.
Sporting houses were as easy to identify&mdash;Lola&rsquo;s, Diamond Kate, Big
Mollie, Diamond Tooth Lil&rsquo;s, and so on. On this street a dozen dance
halls employed over three hundred girls. There was night life for
all, and plenty of participants, with ample reserve in the nearby hills.
However there was very little trouble, as the people made their own
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
laws and upheld them. An example was in December of 1882 when
a bartender sold a drink to a minor. Instantly the town was up in
arms. They gathered and destroyed his stock of liquor valued at
$3,000.00.</p>

<p>The building of the D. &amp; R. G. Railroad started northward up the
Animas Canyon, a natural route, soon to be blasted out by the construction
force. This closed the toll road, as much of the road was to
be used for the railroad bed. The train reached Silverton July 18,
1882, over forty-five miles of one of the D. &amp; R. G.&rsquo;s most scenic
routes. The first steel rails made by the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Works of Pueblo went into this track at a price of $70.00 a ton. Previously,
all rails had been made of iron. The pioneers thought their
transportation troubles were over, but they soon learned the elements
were unbeaten. Snowslides, washouts, and floods were unconquered,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
and there were plenty of all before too many years.
However, the &ldquo;Silverton&rdquo; has the longest record of continuous operation
of any narrow gauge railroad in the country, and does the greatest
passenger business per mile of any scheduled train in the United
States. Silverton&rsquo;s first telegraph came with the arrival of the train
service.</p>

<p class="pcap">Toll Road Between Ouray and Silverton. Present Day

<p>The rich discovery of the Yankee Girl Mine in Ironton Park
made necessary a road from Ouray to Red Mountain, and Otto Mears,
with his associates, built 12 miles. About half of this was cut into
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
solid rock walls of the Uncompahgre Canyon. The road was then extended
twelve miles from Red Mountain into Silverton. This Ouray-Silverton
road, through the Uncompahgre Canyon and over the
gorgeous Red Mountain, constitutes Mr. Mears&rsquo; most spectacular accomplishment,
and still remains the most scenic of all Colorado highways.
This was the route used by the famous Circle Route Stage for
years. It was a daily service by stage coach and horses and later by
automobile. There was a toll gate at Bear Creek Falls that operated
from 1887 to 1900. A little cabin in which the attendant stayed,
was built near the creek and a big pole laid across the bridge. When
anyone drove up, he shouted for the toll keeper who came out, lifted
the pole, and collected the fee, which was $5.00 for a single team,
and $1.00 for each additional head of stock.</p>
<p>A water system for Silverton was built by a group of Denver
and Kansas City capitalists. The source of supply was from Boulder
Creek and a five-inch pipeline was laid from there to the present reservoir
at the upper end of Greene Street.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Famous Grand Imperial Hotel</p>

<p>The Grand Hotel was the finest, and an elegant structure when
built in 1883. From without
it looks exactly as it
did when it opened; however,
the inside was restored
and refurbished in
1952. Originally, it had
fifty-four rooms and three
baths, but today offers
travelers forty rooms with
bath. The beautiful mahogany
bar was built for
the Grand in 1882 in Denver
and shipped by the
railroad in sections, and
the three plate glass mirrors
in the back bar are
the originals purchased in
France. Today it again is
the finest of resort hotels,
and is open the year around.
This is the birthplace of the famous song, &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a
Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&rdquo;. One night a stranger was sitting
in the bar when the wife of a colored porter came hurrying
into the hotel lobby saying, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t find that coon, there will be
a hot time in this old town tonight&rdquo;. The words inspired the stranger
and he took a piece of paper from his pocket and wrote the song.
The Hub Saloon, which was located in the Grand, never closed its
doors nor locked its safe except to turn on the safety catch. One
night a new porter twirled the tumbler and the place had to operate
on borrowed funds until a safe man could get here from Denver
to open it. Jack Slattery, owner of the Hub, once hired major league
baseball players to play ball in Silverton just for his entertainment.</p>
<p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Church was organized, and in 1883 a new church
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
building was erected. The
colored people of the

Catholic church building
and had it moved to a lot
on Mineral Street. This
year the I.O.O.F. was instituted.</p>

<p>During the winter of
1883, mail was being carried
from Silverton to
Ophir on snow shoes by
Swede Nilson. While he
was getting ready to
leave for Ophir, he kept
looking at the grey sky,
as it was snowing hard.
His friends had tried to
persuade him to wait until
after the blizzard, but
Swede knew how anxious
the people in Ophir were
to get their mail, as it
was December 21&mdash;Christmas
time. The postal attendant helped strap the thirty pound sack
of mail on his back and was apprehensive as he watched him start
off in the storm. Days passed with no word from Nilson and it was
ascertained that he had never reached Ophir. At first everyone
thought he had been caught in a snowslide, but when spring came,
folks began to wonder. They searched the trail but he was not found
that season. It was believed that there was considerable Christmas
money in the mail sack and rumors circulated that the Swede had
rifled the sack and skipped the country. Everyone had almost forgotten
Nilson when in August 1885 he was found on the north
side of the slope with the mail pack still on his back. He had been
caught in a snow slide and buried under tons of snow.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1884, just two years after the arrival of the
D. &amp; R. G. into Silverton, a heavy storm with numerous snow slides
closed the road for 77 days, from February 5th to April 22nd.

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>In June, Otto Mears began the construction of the Silverton
Railroad&mdash;a narrow three-foot gauge track of sixteen miles, including
several switch-backs from Silverton to Red Mountain and Ironton
Park. It was completed to Red Mountain in September 1889
and the Ironton stretch was completed in November, the same year.
The road cost $75,000.00, at that time a large amount of money
for one man to raise. This railroad made possible the shipment of
low grade ores from the Red Mountain district to the Silverton
Smelter for treatment. In 1889 Mears started construction of the
Silverton Northern Railroad to tap the mining district north of
Silverton. This line boasted a unique combination dining car and
sleeper, with an extensive wine card printed in two colors and a
menu whose items ranged from Porter House to Antelope cutlets.
At the height of its fortunes it was one of the best money makers
in the entire United States. At a time when passenger trains on
main lines were grossing $1.00 a mile, the Silverton Northern four
passenger runs a day were grossing $20.00 a mile, and freight trains
of ore from the mines so rich that armed guards rode them all
the way to the smelter in Durango. First Mears built five miles of
track to Howardsville, then in 1894 he added four miles extending
the line to Eureka. In 1903 he built another four miles to Animas
Forks. The line to Eureka was used until the Sunnyside mine closed
in 1939.</p>
<p>In 1889, San Juan County took advantage of the voting franchise
for women and elected Nellie Tulley as the first woman
treasurer of the state.</p>
<p>Gem Chapter Number 15, O. E. S. was organized in 1893 and
in 1894 the Miners Union. In 1901, the Miners Union built their
hall at an expenditure of over $35,000.00. The Union had a
membership of over 1300.</p>

<p>Among the ladies, there were two clubs. The Silverton Women&rsquo;s
Club was organized by Mrs. E. G. Stoiber in April 1897 and was
admitted to the State Federation the same year. The San Juan
Women&rsquo;s Club was organized in January, 1900 and was admitted
to the State Federation the same year and the General Federation
the following year. The San Juan Club still functions, and has an
active membership of 17.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s Episcopal Church of Silverton and Christian Science
Church of Silverton were organized in 1898.</p>
<p>The latter part of August 1901, Silverton had its first telephone
communication. The Colorado Telephone Company ran its lines from
Denver through Glenwood Springs, Grand Junction, Delta, Montrose,
Ouray and then into Silverton. The first telephone office was
upstairs in the back room of the building now known as the Recreation
Hall. Phones were installed as fast as equipment would
allow. The first out-of-town phone went to the Sunnyside Mine at
Eureka. It was a year before the lines to Durango were in and
ready for use.</p>
<p>In 1901 the town of Silverton purchased for $40,000.00 the
water works, formerly owned by a private company. They have
since expended much more for improvements. Our water is still
as clear and pure as the days when the first prospector slaked his
thirst from the brim of his battered hat.</p>
<p>The privately owned electric light system broke down during
Christmas week of both the years 1901 and &rsquo;02 on account of
excessive demands for lights and power. The citizens voted bonds
for a municipally owned utility and in 1903 the new system was in
operation. This was the second alternating plant to be built in the
United States. This year, Silverton also had a municipally owned
sewer system which gave us the further distinction of being the
first town to own all three&mdash;lights, water and sewer systems.</p>

<p>The first automobile to reach Silverton came over Stony Pass
on the 26th of August, 1910. It was owned and driven by Dr. D. L.
Mechling of Denver. The car made the trip up the Rio Grande&mdash;the
same route used by the pioneers in the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s. Much road work
had to be done as they went along. At the last steep pitch, horses
had to come to the rescue and pull the car to the top of the Pass,
which has an elevation of 12,500 feet. On the top of the Pass they
saw two women and a man, the latter waving high the American
Flag. They had walked and climbed some ten miles to be the first
to greet the travelers. As they started down the Pass they were
greeted every few hundred yards by people waving and shouting.
They finally reached Silverton and came to a stop in front of the
City Hall. Bells were ringing, the band struck up a tune, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
whole town turned out to welcome the party. The car was a thirty
horsepower Croxton Keeton, a model patterned after a French
Flinch by Renault, but built in United States at cost of $4,500.00.
The next day, with the assistance of the county team, the car succeeded
in getting to Ouray.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Buchanan, the County Attorney, owned the first car in
Silverton, a one-cylinder 1911 Cadillac. He didn&rsquo;t use the car much,
and the following year he sold it to Mr. Hinkley. With much sputtering
and smoking, Mr. Hinkley managed to get it down Reese
Street. Two years later, Mr. H. B. Maris was the owner of the second
car in town, a racy little four cylinder model without a top. This
was the first car to make the trip to Ouray on its own power.</p>
<p>Early in October, 1911 a rainy season of several weeks duration
caused a flood in the Animas Canyon washing out the railroad
track, bridges and even the rock railroad bed. Consequently, Silverton
had a nine weeks blockade. This came before the merchants had
their supplies of goods, foods, and coal for the winter. This was
of course, before the days of the highways, and we depended
entirely on the railroad, but Silverton again came through without
any real suffering, and even had the courage and foresight to erect
the present school building at this time.</p>

<p class="pcap">Burros Loaded With Track Iron Ready To Leave Silverton</p>
</div>
<p>In 1913 work was started in earnest on the highway from
Durango to Silverton. The first car went over this part of the highway
in the fall of 1918. However, the road was not officially
opened for travel until 1920. Bill Compton, Roy Roff, Fred Salfisberg,
Bob Lockwood and one or two others from the power company
made the trip, which was a hard one. They had to lay planks
across the culverts, as there were open holes. They encountered
many difficulties, but finally reached Silverton with the glory of
being the first car over the road.</p>
<p>In 1916, the road up to the Cement Fill was being constructed.
Previously, the road went up South Mineral to Chattanooga Creek
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
then turned and went up a very steep pitch to the present highway
near Johnson&rsquo;s Park. Usually passengers had to walk up this pitch
to make the load lighter for the teams and also to give a push
now and then.</p>
<p>The Sunnyside Mill was in operation in 1917 at Eureka. At
first it handled 500 tons of ore per day, and later more units were
added and 1,000 tons were put through daily, the company built
and furnished a number of houses in Eureka for their employees
and families. When production was at its peak, around four hundred
were employed. In 1919 a terrific fire destroyed most of the
buildings at the mine, and only the tram terminal and transformer
house remained usable. The company rebuilt at once and mining
continued on a large scale until December 1921, when they ceased
operation due to the drop in the metal market. They reopened
in 1922 and operated continually until 1930 in spite of a flood that
washed out the railroad with no train for thirty days. They closed
again until 1937 when the property reopened and operated for
about eighteen months.</p>

<p>In 1918 the &ldquo;flu&rdquo; epidemic struck the area, with great loss
of life. San Juan County probably had a greater proportion of
deaths than any section of the nation. The usual percentage was
about ten percent afflicted with the disease, of which about one or
two percent died. Silverton suffered a loss of nine percent of our
entire population within three weeks. Graves could not be dug fast
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
enough, and it became necessary to bury in trenches. One trench
contained sixty-two bodies.</p>
<p>The highway from Silverton to Ouray was dedicated in 1924
as the Million Dollar Highway. The dedication took place on the
first large turn below the Treasury Tunnel Mine, and in 1926 a
Memorial was erected at Bear Creek Falls in honor of Otto Mears,
Pioneer Roadbuilder.</p>
<p>On March 8, 1927 the first airplane flew over Silverton. This
flight was arranged by Representative E. J. Holman of San Juan
County and was supposedly a &ldquo;Mercy Flight&rdquo; to the stricken snow
bound people of Silverton as the train had been blocked for thirty-three
days at this time. Letters, newspapers, and antitoxin were
dropped north of town near the sub station. Helen Fleming, who
still resides here, received a letter on this plane and was offered
$5.00 for the envelope stamp by a stamp collector in California.
She refused to sell, but her Mother sold one she had received at
that time.</p>
<p>Then on May 24, 1932 a Travel Air six-place monoplane made
a three-point landing on the Million Dollar Highway at the foot
of Greene Street. The pilot, Walter Piele, brought the plane from
Durango, and it was the first to land here. The pilot later lost his
license for making the landing.</p>
<p>The last long blockade was in February 1932 and lasted ninety
days. The slides came down, blocking the highways and railroad
almost to Needleton. Supplies and mail were brought up the track
from Needleton by mule pack train and men with toboggans
freighted supplies from Ouray.</p>
<p>The following was taken from a Denver Post clipping of April
7, 1932: &ldquo;For the first time in history of the postoffice department,
it is believed, a ton of hay has been shipped by parcel post. This
was revealed Wednesday in a report to the State Utilities Commission.
The hay was badly needed to feed dairy cattle in the
snowbound town of Silverton and was ordered by the Mullin Lumber
Company of Silverton from the Farmer&rsquo;s Supply Company of
Durango. The Durango firm was unable to ship the hay by freight
because the railroad stops sixteen miles from Needleton Pass. It
was decided to throw the responsibility on Uncle Sam for the delivery
of the hay. The hay was pressed into bundles to conform
with the maximum size and weight specified for parcel post and
offered to the postmaster at Durango. The postage amounted
to $14.00. When the hay had reached the end of the railroad it
was transferred to Silverton by pack mule at a cost to the post office
department of 5c a pound. Thus, the post office department lost
$86.00 on the transaction but the cows in Silverton will munch hay
for a few days at least, and the children of the isolated town will
have fresh milk again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silverton&rsquo;s ore reserves have been only &ldquo;scratched&rdquo;. This
area is the most highly mineralized area in the United States, for in
very few mining districts of the world are to be found the extensive
variety of ores that abound in this country. Until 1893 no gold in
the ore was paid for except when it was plainly visible to the naked
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
eye or made a good showing in the pan. In the Sunnyside extension
several hundred thousand dollars were taken out in free gold.
Kendall Mountain and Silver Lake Basin have been the center of free
gold discoveries at intervals since 1872. The first free gold in the
country was taken from the Little Giant lode, three sacks of which
were reported to have been worth $4,000 to $5,000. This was in
1872. In 1905 and &rsquo;06 the Old Hundred Mine produced considerable
free gold, taking from $30,000 to $40,000 off the plates each
month in a forty stamp mill.</p>
<p>Many of the mines used aerial trams to transport the ore over
the surface to the mills and railroads. Among some of the larger
trams are: Gold Prince, 13,000 feet; Sunnyside, 15,600 feet; Kittemac,
10,000 feet; Iowa Tiger, 14,375 feet; Silver Lake, 13,730
feet; Mogul, 10,000 feet; and Shenandoah, 10,000 feet.</p>
<p>Divided into forty prominent gulches, each one a fair sized
mining district in itself, the county displays a vast network of big
veins of low grade ore in addition to the occasional rich strikes. San
Juan is the center of a mineral empire, with ore, coal, timber, water
and power. It needs business men, builders of enterprise, to make
fortunes for themselves and to bring out the great wealth that still
lies in the mountains. The decline in mining activity in the county
has been due primarily to the decline in metal prices&mdash;not shortage
of ore.</p>
<p>Since the earliest records were kept, the county, through 1957,
has produced $138,218,339 in gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc.
Gold has led the values in this county with a total of thirty-nine
and a half million dollars; lead was a close second with over thirty-six
million; silver third, with over thirty and a half million. Copper
totaled $12,353,827, and zinc $19,406,616.</p>
<p>There are seven &ldquo;Ghost Towns&rdquo; in the immediate area; Howardsville,
five miles northeast, is the location of the first court house.
There were numerous buildings here including a post office and
school, many of which still stand. Middleton, located in the 1890&rsquo;s
is two miles above Howardsville. It also had a postoffice and school
and is the site of the Nugget and Kittemac Mines. Eureka, established
in the 1870&rsquo;s, became a ghost town in 1938. As I have
previously mentioned, this was the site of the Sunnyside Mine and
there were over six hundred inhabitants. One of the few remaining
buildings you will see is the old town hall and fire house.</p>
<p>A few miles farther up the Animas River Canyon is Animas
Forks, which was one of the busiest mining centers. The railroad
served this place and the big activity was at the Gold Prince Mill.
Animas Forks also supported a number of thriving businesses, including
a fine newspaper, school and post office. The big attraction
here today is the old jail, built entirely of 2 &times; 6&rsquo;s and hand-forged
window bars. The townsite was laid out in the late 1870&rsquo;s and was
deserted by 1923.</p>
<p>At the head of the Animas is Mineral Point. It was an important
stage stop for the Silverton to Ouray stage coaches as this road
was used while the present Million Dollar Highway was under construction.
They boasted of having the highest post office in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
United States. There is probably no area in the county where outcrops
are so numerous and lodes and veins are so conspicuous, as
in the area immediately surrounding Mineral Point. The summit
of Mineral Point is formed of a heavy vein of nearly solid white
quartz sixty feet wide.</p>

<p>Since the first, Silverton has run the gamut of hope and
prosperity. Around it boom towns turned into ghost towns, but
Silverton has gone on almost unchanged. The silver panic of 1893
and the national panic of 1907 wiped out many mining towns, but
Silverton has become known as, &ldquo;A Mining Camp that Never Quits&rdquo;.</p>

copy of the article:</p>
<p>The long awaited decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington D. C., was handed down Wednesday morning
and assures continuation of the Narrow Gauge Line from Durango
to Silverton for an undetermined time.</p>
<p>A telegram from Senator John Carroll and Congressman Wayne
Aspinall was received by the Silverton Standard early Wednesday
morning, and read as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy to inform you Interstate Commerce Commission this
morning issued decision refusing to permit abandonment by Rio
Grande Railroad of narrow gauge railway connecting Durango and
Silverton. This preserves status of line as a common carrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Silverton people were quite sure such a decision would
be forthcoming it is gratifying to know that the action of the commission
was final and in our favor.</p>
<p>The narrow gauge line has been operating into Silverton since
1882 and is at present one of the last and oldest regularly scheduled
passenger lines in the United States operating on a three-foot track.</p>
<p>Business over the line has been growing steadily for twelve
years. Last year the passenger figure hit near the 40,000 mark and
an increase is noted annually.</p>
